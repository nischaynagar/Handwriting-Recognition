        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        Handwriting recognition (HWR) is the ability of a computer to receive
        and interpret intelligible handwritten input from sources such as paper
        documents, photographs, touch-screens and other devices. One of the
        means of identifying an individual is through his/her handwriting
        pattern, since there exists a certain degree of stability in the pattern
        of an individual’s writing style, by which it is possible to identify
        the author. Here the input will be given as an image of the handwritten
        text. The image of the written text may be sensed “off line” from a
        piece of paper by optical scanning (optical character recognition) or
        intelligent word recognition. Alternatively, the movements of the pen
        tip may be sensed “on line”, for example by a pen-based computer screen
        surface, a generally easier task as there are more clues available.

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        In the modern world of technology gadgets and tech services including
        the giant internet have shaped the way we interact, work and live. This
        modernization and technical advancement has further impacted the
        economic and social lifestyle of various people in various regions.
        Nowadays mobile phones and portable computers with reduced size have an
        issue with large sized typing pads. As portable computers become more
        personal and are made smaller, they reach some physical limitations for
        having a keyboard. For pocket size computers (PDA’s) one cannot use an
        efficient keyboard. For these computers alternative ways of man-machine
        communication are necessary.

      <h3>Real world applications</h3>
      <div className="mb-4">
        Handwriting OCR can be used in a variety of real-world scenarios from as
        simple as converting your handwriting into text to reading numbers off a
        number plate of a suspicious car. The fields where this technology can
        be implemented are enormous. In most cases people find it much more
        comfortable to write on paper rather than typing it out. Numerous
        authors or editors prefer paper written over typed text. Our piece of
        software can largely help these types of people. Even though the world
        is pushing into a cyber age where computers are dominating every aspect
        of our lives a huge chunk of information is still recorded and
        handwritten on paper. Our application will help libraries and
        organizations digitize their data with much ease and less manpower. Our
        application can also make reading postal addresses, bank check amounts
        and forms much easier as these are usually handwritten and digital
        back-ups can be done cheaply, and potentially, an infinite number of
        times; instead of maintaining costly duplicates and triplicates in paper
        form. Combined with the above, OCR renders paperwork a lot more
        sustainable. Another aspect of Handwriting OCR is translatability as a
        document handwritten in a language can easily be turned into a machine
        typed document and then using a simple translating software we can
        translate the given handwritten document into a familiar language.
